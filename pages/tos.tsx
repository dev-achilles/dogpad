            5. Know your Customer ("KYC") and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Policy
          </h2>
          <p>
            5.1. BlokPad is a permissionless, fully decentralized platform for
            token sales, swaps, and decentralized exchange. As a software
            development company, BlokPad has no role in enforcing KYC by
            default, however, we do provide such tools for fundraising entities
            using BlokPad to enforce on their users, if the entities choose to
            do so. The use of KYC/AML tools on BlokPad by fundraising entities
            using the Service is completely at the discretion of said entities.
            BlokPad is implementing KYC tools into our launchpad through{" "}
            <a href="https://kycaid.com/">KYCAid</a>. Please refer to their{" "}
            <a href="https://kycaid.com/terms-and-conditions">
              Terms and Conditions
            </a>{" "}
            and{" "}
            <a href="https://kycaid.com/data-protection-policy">
              Data protection policy
            </a>
          </p>
          <p>
            5.2. Although BlokPad makes no warranty as to the merit, legality,
            or juridical nature of any token (including whether or not it is
            considered a security or financial instrument under any applicable
            Securities Laws), token sale or fundraiser on top of BlokPad, we
            nonetheless understand the need of some token projects to require
            KYC/AML on their token sale participants.
          </p>
          <p>
            5.3. Therefore, and at the sole behest of fundraising entities
            and/or competent regulatory authorities, BlokPad reserves the right
            at any time:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              To ask for any KYC documentation it deems necessary to determine
              the identity and location of a User.
            </li>
            <li>
              To restrict service and payment until identity is sufficiently
              determined.
            </li>
            <li>
              To share submitted KYC information and documentation to 3rd
              parties to verify the authenticity of submitted information, and
              the end-user (you) agrees to this by using the Service.
            </li>
            <li>
              To confiscate any and all funds that are found to be in violation
              of relevant and applicable anti-money laundering (AML) and
              countering terrorism financing (CFT) laws and regulations, and to
              cooperate with the competent authorities when and if necessary.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            5.4. Although BlokPad makes no warranty as to the merit, legality,
            or juridical nature of any IDO token, we nonetheless understand the
            need of IDO fundraising projects to require KYC/AML Verification on
            their token sale participants of Users. Therefore, BlokPad reserves
            the right:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              At any time, to ask for your personal information, Name-Surname,
              Birthday, e-mail address, nationality, location, government
              identification number (Identification Card/Passport number and
              Date of Identification Card/Passport issuing), telegram username,
              BEP-20 wallet address, and any KYC documentation with the liveness
              test that it deems necessary to determine the identity and
              location of a User, and reserves the right to restrict Service and
              payment until identity is sufficiently determined;
            </li>
            <li>
              The liveness test shall mean taking a photo of your government
              identification with your phone or camera. Then, also take a photo
              of yourself (selfie of your face) holding your ID document and the
              paper you wrote on next to your face (not covering your face).
            </li>
            <li>
              To share the submitted KYC information and documentation to the
              third parties to verify the authenticity of submitted information,
              and the end user (you) agree to this by using the Service;
            </li>
            <li>
              To reject the use of the Service that BlokPad has the reasonable
              ground to believe that they are found to be in violation of
              relevant and applicable AML/CFT laws and regulations, and to
              cooperate with the competent authorities or any investigation when
              and if necessary upon the valid request by the court order.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            5.6. BlokPad expressly prohibits and rejects the use of the Service
            for any form of illicit activity, including money laundering,
            terrorist financing or trade sanctions violations, consistent with
            various jurisdictions’ laws, regulations and norms. To that end, the
            Service is not offered to individuals or entities on any Politically
            Exposed Persons (“PEP”) lists, or subject to any United States,
            European Union, or other global sanctions or watch lists. By using
            the Service, you represent that you are not on any such lists.
          </p>
          <p>
            5.7. You fully acknowledge that your information and KYC
            documentation may be disclosed to government agencies or regulator
            upon the only valid request of the court order. Once you have
            decided to participate in any IDO fundraising event and start
            staking your BlokPad Tokens, you must ensure that all information
            provided to BlokPad is complete, accurate, and updated in a timely
            manner. BlokPad will rely on the information you provided and should
            there be any reasonable grounds to believe that the partial or the
            whole of your information provided to us is incomplete, or
            incorrect, or outdated, BlokPad reserves the right to send you a
            notice to demand correction, or to delete such information directly,
            and, as the case may be, to prohibit you to access to all or part of
            BlokPad website and the Services.
          </p>
          <p>
            5.8. If BlokPad has the reasonable ground to believe that any user
            transacts or use the Services by using the digital currencies
            derived from any suspicious illegal activities, BlokPad shall be
            entitled to freeze/close/delete accounts as necessary. BlokPad will
            hold no liability to such users for any damage, or loss arising out
            of or in connection with this manner herein. Please note that any
            attempt to circumvent this Clauses will also result in a similar
            action.
